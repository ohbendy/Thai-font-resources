## Languages supported by Thai script

With __language__ tags for OpenType and ISO 639. 

For making and testing fonts, we need to know the OpenType language tags as well as the ISO 639 language tags; to achieve variant forms for Pali/Sanskrit, for example, a font's OpenType lookups need to be registered under `PAL ` and `SAN `, but the HTML language needs to be set as `pi` or `sa`. Many of these languages do not have OpenType language tags, but this is not a problem unless those languages require specific glyphs or shaping (different to default behaviour).

Number of speakers is very approximate in some cases, and should not be taken as an estimate of number of script users as literacy rates vary and the total number of speakers of a language may live in different countries and use different scripts. Likewise languages no longer spoken do not imply there are no script users, since Pali and Sanskrit are used for religious and academic purposes.
